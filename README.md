# Algorithms in Rust
Here's a place for me to practice implementing algorithms in Rust as I learn about both algorithms and data structures and Rust itself.

I'm coming from a background in C++ and some Haskell, so it'll be interesting to see how that affects my initial approach to the implementation of some of these things.
